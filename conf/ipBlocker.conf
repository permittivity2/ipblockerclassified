# Lines that begin with a comment (#) are ignored
# Think of each line as a key[sub-key][sub-sub-key]=value pair
# Duplicates are allowed.  The last one wins!
# This is beign used by perl so let's keep a few thigns in mind:
#   1. False value is 0.  Period.  That's it.  0 (zero) is false.  Everything else is true.
#   2. Regular expressions are PERL regular expressions.  So they are case insensitive and use PERL regular expressions.
#   3. Unless otherwise noted, sorting is regular perl sorting.  So 1, 10, 11 come before 2, 20, 21, etc.
