# ipblockerclassified
A classed and threaded version of ipBlocker


I started ipBlocker over ten years ago.  It works.  It works very well.

However, another fella made Fail2Ban (https://www.keycdn.com/support/fail2ban).

I like the idea of Faile2Ban except it doesn't work.  I have tried a few times.  After a while the various scripts stop reading files.  It just locks up or something.  I have tried to debjug it.  I have changed lots of parameters.  Etc etc.  No bueno.

So, here is my code to try to take what I did over ten years ago and make it something better.
